# Library-automation-system-lautech
so this is a system created to save the library admistrator and student lot's of stress, such that on sign up the a barcode is generated for the user and whenever the user comes into the library, the administraor can just simply scan the barcode to check the user in and out, all the books in thee library are uploaded by the admin so after check in a student can search a book then click on read or borrow and for the read after there is a page to complete reading a particular book, as well as for the borrow you can return the book by the admin scanning the barcode generated when you borrowed the book, admins can suspend, unsuspend and create new sub-admins, to add when a student creates an account the matric number is same as the password due to how lautech portal works, but for safety to login a user needs to enter an otp before logging in as well as for the admins except no matric number for the admin, there are many more features....do take your time to explore around, any question or contribution you can reach out to me.
